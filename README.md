Author: Jeng Bai-Cheng(rjeng@nvidia.com)

An example code is worth a thousand words. This repository intends to host fundamental, but useful examples. Each example is just a few dozen lines of code. Most of them come from my past experience in HPC projects, but readers do not need to have the HPC background to understand the examples.

### Basic ###
* [matmul_multigpu](/matmul_multigpu) - matrix multiplication with multi-GPU
